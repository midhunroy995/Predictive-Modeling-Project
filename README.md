## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HousePricePrediction.git
   cd HousePricePrediction

2. Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

4. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the Jupyter Notebooks:
   .Start Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook
   .Open 'notebboks/eda.ipynb' for exploratory data analysis.
   .Open 'notebooks/modeling.ipynb' for model training and evaluation.
Usage
1. Load and preprocess the data:
   Modify'src/HousePricePrediction/data/load_data.py' and 'src/HousePricePrediction/preprocessing/preprocess.py' if necessary to match your dataset and preprocessing needs.

2. Perform EDA:
   Use the 'eda.ipynb' notebook to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset.

3. Train and evaluate models:
    use the 'modeling.ipynb' notebook to train and evaluate machine learning models.

Configuration

The 'config/config.yaml' file contains configuration settings for the project,
including paths to data files and model parameters.
